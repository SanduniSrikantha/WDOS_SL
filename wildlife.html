                    <h2>Udawalawe National Park</h2>
                    <p>Udawalawe National Park just south of Sri Lanka’s central mountains, is a large reserve made up of 119 square miles of grassland, scrub jungle and riverine forest. The main attraction of the park is the large concentration of Asian elephants found here, Udawalawe is home to over 400 of these gentle giants and it is almost guaranteed to see them whilst on safari. A favorite hangout for the herds of elephants is the Walawe Reservoir where the creatures come to drink during times of water scarcity. </p>
                    <p>Udawalawe National Park is also home to some other exciting wildlife including the mugger crocodile, sambar, spotted and barking deer, wild boar, water buffalo and jackal whilst the birding is excellent with nearly 200 species recorded. November to March is the optimal time for birdwatching expeditions with the chance to spot exciting raptors such as the changeable hawk-eagle, serpent eagle and grey-headed fish eagle. </p>

                    <h2>Wilputtu National Park</h2>
                    <p>Situated in the dry lowlands in the northwest of Sri Lanka, Wilpattu is the country’s largest national park. In Sinhalese, Wilpattu translates as ‘natural lakes’ and you will find many glistening lakes dotted around the reserve. Due to low visitor numbers this national park emanates a real sense of wilderness and authenticity, however, the wildlife is slightly wary of visitors therefore sightings are less likely than in the more popular parks. </p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, Wilpattu National Park is a wonderful expedition, and the promising fauna is some of the best Sri Lanka has to offer. Regal leopards prowl through the scrub, crocodiles bathe in the many lakes, deer roam and peafowl parade throughout the park. Other interesting wildlife that can be spotted include monitor lizards, tortoises, flycatchers and jungle fowl. </p>>

                    <h2>Mirissa's Coast</h2>
                    <p>Mirissa, a small beach town on Sri Lanka’s south coast, is the number one hotspot for whale watching in the country. Witnessing whales breaching in the crashing waves is a rare encounter and nowhere is better to experience this in Sri Lanka than in Mirissa. Using a reputable and eco-friendly company, ride into the deep sea and come face-to-face with these fascinating creatures. You are likely to see blue whales, with the chance of also meeting sperm, fin and killer whales. May to October is the prime whale watching season. </p>
                    <p>During a whale watching trip you may also be lucky enough to see a variety of dolphins including bottlenose, common and spinner dolphins, and sometimes you will encounter mesmerizing sea turtles bobbing along the shore. </p>

                    <h2>Hikkaduwa Marine National Park</h2>
                    <p>Declared a Nature Reserve in 1988 and then upgraded to national park status in 2002, the Hikkaduwa National Park in the southern province is one of only two marine national parks in Sri Lanka. Although the southern coastline is home to many coral reefs, the reefs in Hikkaduwa are the most diverse and accessible and offer some of the country’s best snorkeling and diving opportunities. </p>
                    <p>The main reef of Hikkaduwa sits in a sheltered lagoon, it is a typical fringing reef with an average depth of about 5 meters. The coral is colorful and diverse with around 60 varied species including boulder and encrusting corals, small-strands of Acropora coral and the cabbage-like Monti Pora coral. The seagrass is home to sea turtles, whilst tropical reef fish such as parrot fish, angel fish and butterfly fish skirt through the corals. Along the outer slope of the reef, blacktip reef sharks can be found along with hawksbill and green turtles. </p>
